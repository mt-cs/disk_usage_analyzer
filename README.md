# Project 1: Elastic Array and Disk Usage Analyzer

Author: Marisa Tania  

## About Elist Directory

This directory traversal and disk usage anylisis use a custom elastic array data structure. The elastic array is dynamic and can store unbounded number of elements depending on what memory permits. It is a a reusable C library that will be useful down the line.

The disk analyzer traverses all the files from the current root directory recursively. Every fileâ€™s absolute path, byte size, and last access time will be stored in a struct entries and listed out in the elastic array.

### Help/Usage Information
To get a sense of the functionality of the Elist Directory disk usage analyzer, here is the help/usage information:
```bash
$ ./da -h
Disk Analyzer (da): analyzes disk space usage
Usage: ./da [-ahs] [-l limit] [directory]

If no directory is specified, the current working directory is used.

Options:
    * -a              Sort the files by time of last access (descending)
    * -h              Display help/usage information
    * -l limit        Limit the output to top N files (default=unlimited)
    * -s              Sort the files by size (default, ascending)
```
User can sort the directories based on the size ascendingly, or time of last access descendingly. They also have the options to show limited numver of output.

### Elist Functions
The elastic array implements these following functions:
- <b>elist_add</b>: appends an element to the array
- <b>elist_add_new</b>: creates storage space for a new element and returns a pointer to it
- <b>elist_capacity</b>: retrieves the current list capacity
- <b>elist_clear_mem</b>: removes all elements from the array and zeroes them out
- <b>elist_create</b>: initializes a new elist data structure
- <b>elist_destroy</b>: destroys and frees any memory allocated by an elist
- <b>elist_get</b>: retrieves a particular element by its index
- <b>elist_index_of</b>: determines the index of a particular element
- <b>elist_remove</b>: removes an element at a particular index
- <b>elist_set</b>: replaces an element in the array at a particular index
- <b>elist_set_capacity</b>: increases or decreases the storage capacity of the array
- <b>elist_size</b>: retrieves the number of elements in the array
- <b>elist_sort</b>: sorts the array


### Included Files
There are several files included. These are:
   - <b>Makefile</b>: Including to compile and run the program.
   - <b>da.c</b>: The disk usage analyzer to traverse directory
   - <b>elist.c</b>: Elastic array to store elements dinamically
   - <b>util.c</b>: Helper function to converts bytes sizes and time to human-readable format string
   - <b>logger.h</b>: Helps facilitate debugging by providing basic logging functionality.

There are also header files: elist.h, until.h.

To compile and run:

```bash
make
./da
```


### Program Output
```bash
$ ./da -l 15 -s /usr

```

In this output example, the user requested the top 15 files (-l 15), sorted by size (-s) from the /usr directory. 
The output columns include the file name, file size in human readable units, and the last time the particular file was accessed.

## Testing

To execute the test cases, use `make test`. To pull in updated test cases, run `make testupdate`. You can also run a specific test case instead of all of them:

```
# Run all test cases:
make test

# Run a specific test case:
make test run=4

# Run a few specific test cases (4, 8, and 12 in this case):
make test run='4 8 12'
```
